MyContraception is a patient-centered contraceptive app, which we developed in respect to the needs of women to effectively prevent unintended pregnancies while conducting a stress-free healthy lifestyle, the WHO’s MEC for contraception’s recommendations, and the results of the field study conducted in the reproductive health center Les Oranges in Rabat to collect the app's requirements.

The app has been developed in an attempt to facilitate : 
1. Seeking evidence-based information along with recommendations concerning the best contraceptive fit (according to one’s medical characteristics and preferences) helping users make informed decisions about their contraceptive choices.
2. Monitoring one’s own menstrual cycle, fertility window, contraceptive methods usage, and the correlation between these different elements and everyday symptoms in one app.
3. Keeping record of one’s family medical history, medical appointments, analyses, diagnoses, procedures and notes within the same app.
